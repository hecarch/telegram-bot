# telegram-bot
Simple and ugly telegram bot to monitor my server

### Quick overview

This bot just aims to get interesting informations about the status of your server when you can't ssh into it (of you can't set up graphana ahem).
Feel free to contribute to add your own functions, or to make this script universal (works only on my machine...).

### What's next
- Get 5 biggest processus and print it
- [Perhaps] Make an "urgent" command to close the server from outside, in case of attack
- Make another python script, launch by cron to send me daily report about what happened
